title: About me!
---

Hi, I’m Hannah – I’m currently studying psychology and neuroscience, which gives me unique insights into how your mind and body work together. While I’m not yet a certified trainer, I’ve spent years researching exercise science and nutrition, and I’ve helped friends and family reach their goals with custom plans and honest, evidence-led coaching. I can’t wait to use what I’m learning to help you feel stronger, healthier, and more confident!
